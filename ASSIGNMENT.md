# AI Agent Workflow Builder — Full-Stack Assignment

**Stack:** nhost + Hasura + PostgreSQL + GraphQL

> **Note:** This assignment is intentionally tough to fully complete as fast as
> possible. Whether you finish all of it is up to you — we're looking for someone who
> can build fast, and who still gets the fundamentals right under pressure: proper
> security, scalable design, not shortcuts that happen to work in a demo.

## What You're Building

A mini n8n, purpose-built for chaining AI agent steps. Users inside an organization build
workflows out of multiple step types, start them multiple ways, and every action is
checked against two separate layers of permissions. The assignment ends in one live
scenario that proves the whole system actually works — not a checklist graded piece by
piece.

This is deliberately **not** a checklist. The final scenario needs the schema, Hasura
config, both permission layers, the Action handler, and live subscriptions to all work
together — get any one piece wrong and the scenario visibly breaks.

## Tech Stack

- **nhost** (Postgres + Hasura + Auth + Storage + Functions)
- **Hasura GraphQL Engine**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **GraphQL** — queries, mutations, subscriptions
- A **real LLM API** for `llm_call` steps — any free tier works (Groq, OpenRouter,
  Gemini). If you can't get access, a stubbed call with a disclosed artificial delay is
  fine.
- **React/Next.js frontend** — required

## Data Model

At minimum:

- `organizations` — with a usage quota (calls used / allowed per period)
- `org_members` — `user_id`, `org_id`, `role` (owner, editor, viewer)
- `workflows` — belongs to an organization
- `workflow_steps` — ordered, with a `type` (see below) and `config` (JSONB is fine)
- `workflow_triggers` — trigger type (see below) tied to a workflow
- `workflow_runs` — one per execution, overall status (must support a paused state)
- `step_runs` — one per step per run — status, input, output, error, attempt count, plus
  `approved_by` / `approved_at` for approval-gate steps

Field names are yours to adjust; the relationships — org → members → workflows →
steps/triggers, workflow → runs → step_runs — need to hold.

## Step Types (Nodes)

Implement at least these:

- `llm_call` — calls a real LLM API
- `http_request` — generic call to any external API
- `db_write` — saves a result into your own tables
- `notify` — Slack/email alert, implemented as an **Event Trigger**
- `conditional_branch` — if/else based on the previous step's output
- `approval_gate` — pauses the run until someone with the right role approves

## Trigger Types

Implement at least these:

- **Manual** — user clicks Run
- **Webhook** — a Hasura Action acting as an inbound endpoint external systems call to
  start a run
- **Scheduled** — cron-based, via a scheduled function
- **Database event** — a row change in a watched table auto-starts a run, via a Hasura
  Event Trigger

## Hasura Layer

- Track all tables, wire up the relationships above
- One **aggregation** — org-level usage this month, or average run duration — as a
  computed field or Postgres view

### Permissions — two layers, not one

**Layer 1 — org + role scoping** (who can see or trigger a workflow at all): role alone
isn't enough — every permission also has to scope to the caller's own org via
`org_members`, so an editor in Org A can never see or touch Org B's data even with the
same role.

- **owner** — full control over workflows, steps, triggers, and org membership
- **editor** — can create/edit workflows and steps, can trigger runs — can't manage
  members
- **viewer** — read-only, cannot trigger a run

**Layer 2 — step-level gating** (who can act on specific steps): some step types reach
outside the sandbox and need tighter control — only an owner can add a `db_write`, a
`webhook` trigger, or a `notify` step. Clearing an `approval_gate` requires the Action
handler itself to check the approver's role before resuming the run — this can't be a
database permission alone, since it's a mid-execution decision, not a simple row read or
write.

## GraphQL Operations

- A **query** returning an org's workflows with their steps, triggers, and most recent
  run status
- A **mutation** to create/edit a workflow, its steps, and its triggers
- A **mutation** to approve a paused `approval_gate` step
- A **subscription** on `step_runs` (filtered to a `workflow_run_id`) for live
  step-by-step progress, including a "paused, awaiting approval" state

## The Integration — the core of the assignment

A Hasura Action, `triggerWorkflowRun(workflow_id)`, backed by a function that:

- Verifies the caller is owner/editor in the workflow's org
- Checks the org's quota isn't exhausted
- Creates the `workflow_run`, then executes steps in order — `llm_call` and
  `http_request` steps make real external calls, with at least one retry on failure
- On hitting an `approval_gate` step, sets the run to paused and stops — a second Action
  (`approveStep`) checks the approver's role before resuming
- Updates `step_runs` / `workflow_run` status throughout, so the subscription reflects it
  live
- Increments the org's quota usage on completion

Plus at least one trigger beyond manual — webhook, scheduled, or event-based — actually
wired to start a run without a button click.

## Frontend

- Auth via nhost, org context
- A screen to build a workflow — add/reorder steps of different types, attach a trigger
- A Run button (hidden for viewers), live per-step status via subscription, including a
  pause/approve UI for `approval_gate` steps
- A usage/quota indicator

## Final Task — what "done" means

Demonstrate this exact scenario working end to end, live:

1. Two separate organizations exist, each with their own users and roles.
2. In Org A, an owner builds a workflow with at least 3 step types, including one
   `llm_call`, one `http_request`, and one `conditional_branch` that changes behavior
   based on the LLM's output.
3. The workflow can be started two ways — manually, and via a webhook or event trigger.
4. One step is an `approval_gate` — the run pauses, and only an owner/editor in that org
   can approve it forward.
5. While running, live status streams step-by-step with no refresh, including the paused
   state.
6. Then, logged in as an Org B user, prove they cannot see, trigger, or approve anything
   belonging to Org A — not even by guessing an ID directly.

If all six hold up in a live walkthrough, the schema, Hasura config, both permission
layers, the Action handler, and the subscriptions all necessarily work — that's why this
is one deliverable instead of six things graded separately.

## Deliverables

- **GitHub repo** with a README covering setup and how to run it locally (API keys, or a
  note if stubbed)
- **Hosted URL** of the deployed Next.js app (Vercel or similar) — reviewers need to open
  the live app, not just read code
- **Hasura metadata/migrations** showing schema, relationships, and both permission
  layers
- A **~1 page write-up**: schema reasoning, how the two permission layers are enforced
  differently, and how the approval-gate pause/resume is implemented
- A **short recording** of the Final Task scenario actually happening — strongly
  recommended given how central it is

## Evaluation Criteria

- The Final Task passes, live — **weighted above everything**
- Cross-org isolation is airtight, including against direct ID guessing
- Step-level permission gating is enforced in the Action handler, not just assumed
- Retry/failure handling and quota enforcement
- Schema and Hasura relationship correctness
- Code and documentation clarity

## Time & Submission

- **Time limit:** depends on you
- Whoever submits earliest gets priority in review — but submitted early *but broken*
  does not win; it's working-and-fast that counts, weighed together with speed.
- **Submit:** GitHub repo link + hosted app URL
